 🛡️ Network Security Architecture Design Project

---Overview---

This repository contains the design, justification, and documentation for a secure network architecture configuration, completed as part of a course on computer systems security. 
The goal was to identify necessary security components and configure them in a layered defense model to protect a conceptual computer system.

 1. Proposed Security Configuration Diagram

The diagram below illustrates the perimeter defense and internal security segmentation, ensuring all external traffic passes through the primary security control point.

2. Component Justification and Explanation

---Comprehensive Network Security Architecture---

The proposed network security architecture employs a robust **Defense-in-Depth** strategy using essential hardware and software components to protect the conceptual computer system. 
At the **perimeter**, all external communications are filtered by a **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)**. This is the foundational hardware appliance, chosen because it doesn't just block ports; 
it performs **deep packet inspection**, identifying and preventing complex threats, malware, and intrusions before they ever enter the network. Crucially, 
the NGFW separates the internal network from the **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**, which is essential for isolating the public-facing **Web Server**. 
The DMZ Switch ensures that if the Web Server is compromised, the threat remains contained in the "lobby" and cannot easily pivot to the internal, trusted **L3 Managed Switches**
that handle internal routing and network segmentation (VLANs). 

To catch threats that bypass the perimeter, an **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)** is positioned behind the firewall. This security appliance monitors traffic flow, 
actively blocking connection attempts that match known malicious signatures, providing a vital secondary layer of protection. All security events across the entire topology, including 
logs from the NGFW, the Web Server, and the IPS, are continuously aggregated and analyzed by the **SIEM Server (Security Information and Event Management)**. This software solution is
necessary for centralized visibility, allowing security analysts to **correlate** disparate alerts into a cohesive incident for rapid response. Finally, **Endpoint Security** software
is mandated on all internal machines, including the **Serv** component. This is the final layer, ensuring that even if a threat penetrates the network, the device itself is protected
against malware and unauthorized changes, establishing a complete security lifecycle.

 3. Tools Used

* **Draw.io (diagrams.net):** Used for creating and visualizing the network topology.
* **Markdown:** Used for documentation and creating this README file.
